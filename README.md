# Final-Project
Final Project for CS-210-Programming-Languages

This Project was comprised of a basic program that a company has requested for me to create to follow up the firsts assignment they gave me. It is essentially an Inventory Status Program which gives the user options as to how they want to have the statistics of their Inventory List to be displayed to them.

In this project, I believe I did particularly well with the structuring of my functions/ methods, and calling those methods in a clean/ concise yet understandable way. 

In regards to areas of improvement, I think acheiving a deeper understanding of the code that I am writing, as I have learned how to create code that accomplishes the desired functions, but I feel if I were asked to describe certain processes going on in my own work I might be confused to do so. Simply reading and practicing more would fix this I beleive. 

As for challenges I faced while finishing the project, I wouldn't say there were any overarching challenges that I facced during the completion of this project, but there were too many minor hurdles that took me what seemed like ages to figure out by going through the class notes.

Skills I am taking away from this project that may be applicable to other work could be today's asignment itself. Actually showcasing my project to get feedback from the rest of the world, and potentially making useful connections with others that can benefit me on my journey into programming. 

This project was made to be readable, maintainable, and adaptable because of the meticulous spacing and styling which matches the standards of my peers (making it easy for any of them to read my work as they read their own. Also the decent amount of comments and notations inserted between my work.
