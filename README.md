Project Software Design Document for "The Gaming Room"

Brief Summary

A mobile gaming company, "The Gaming Room," hired us to update their Android-only drawing game into a cloud-based platform compatible with multiple devices. Their main requirements included maintaining single active game sessions and seamless team-based gameplay across various platforms.

Looking Back
My work with this documentation demonstrates my ability to focus on the technical expectations and objectives of the client rather than potential optimizations that might conflict with their requests. This establishes a professional relationship from the beginning and simplifies the development process, as we are contracted to execute specific tasks for a third party, not to develop the game under our own brand.

Helpful Aspects of the Development Process

I appreciated how the project design document outlined every step of the development process, particularly the logic and reasoning involved in evaluating roadmap options to fulfill client requirements. It also ensured compliance with proper software development standards.

Room for Improvement

Certain parts of the documentation focused excessively on platform specifications long after the client would have finalized decisions based on our initial analysis. This time could have been better spent exploring utilities and tools for the narrowed-down platforms to better serve the client's development needs.

Considering the User's Needs

While the development process may be complete from the client's perspective, successful projects should consider user experience post-launch. The software might face unexpected strain, such as high user volumes during peak logins or attempts to exploit security vulnerabilities. Addressing these potential issues proactively could prevent performance bottlenecks and public controversies related to unoptimized security features.

My Approach to this Project

I prioritized the client's technical and operational requirements at every development stage while allowing flexibility for future upgrades. I also considered potential challenges like security vulnerabilities and server scalability limitations. Moving forward, I would include a detailed framework in the documentation for ongoing audits, user testing, and system upgrades to maintain compatibility with cutting-edge software tools and optimizations.
